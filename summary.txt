Code Summary

I wanted to use Python to code this application, but as it needed to be opened in an HTML 
page, JavaScript and jQuery were a better combo for its DOM manipulation. 

I created the structure of the table first, using jQuery to append classes to the HTML divs
and used CSS to construct the visual of the board, and the effects, such as hover over the column shows 
the opaque color of the player's disc before placement, etc. by using event listeners to tell where you cursor is.
As the player chooses a column to put their disc in, that spot would no longer be empty, and class name would need to be changed
to reflect the disc in that spot; this is achieved by using the different event listeners: hover, click, leave.

Lastly, there is a check for a winner who has 4 in a row at the diagonal, horizontal, vertical levels.
Totals are gathered and at any point if player had 4 in a row, function returns that player as a win.
