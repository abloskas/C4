This is a simple Connect Four game that allows for two players, red and black.
It is made in Javascript and utilizes jQuery for DOM manipulation.


To run this application:
It is in js so it can be played by:

1. Simply opening the index.html file in a browser, 
2. Or by running:  http-server {{pathway to root folder}} in command line

Once running, the game is ready. You can play simply by clicking on the corresponding column that you want to add the disc.
It starts with red for player 1, then goes to black for player 2.
The game will end if: either player reaches 4 in a row diagonally, vertically or horizontally; or if all spaces are filled and there is no winner.

You can restart the game by clicking the "start over" button.

Have fun!
